		<div class = "who-text">Based on Church Street in the heart of Burlington, VT, the Rocket Listings team is a group of avid Craigslist users that kept a running list of things to improve on the Craigslist platform. Eventually, we decided we didn't want to wait around for Craiglist to do it themselves, so we started building tools that we wanted to use. Our mission is to make the whole process of selling a used item online easier, from the minute you want to sell it until you have cash in your hand. <br><br> Please let us know if you think we're doing a good job or if you have any other feedback by emailing <a href ="mailto:info@rocketlistings.com"> info@rocketlistings.com</a> </p>
