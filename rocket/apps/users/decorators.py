    To use this functionality, you need to set the property of request.user.is_owner to a boolean. 
    The way it has been done is that if request.user is equal to the owner of the page being visited skip_count is set to True
    otherwise it is set to false. Check also if the user is logged in with a request.user.is_authenticated().
    Also the decorator needs to be called at the beginning of the function.
