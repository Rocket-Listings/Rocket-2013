			<p>A lot of page loads can really slow down the process, so we put everything in one place. Pick a category, you can select your location or we can auto-include it, upload photos, and fill out the form (we give you important specs to include). You can even toggle to preview mode in the same window so you can what your listing will look like as you make changes.</p>

			<p>Keeping track of all the details and emails for one listing is hard, and gets exponentially more difficult if you have more than one. We put it all in one place so you can keep track of each and every listing easily and know what's going on. You can edit, re-post, delete, and mark an item as sold as well as sort your listings by date, category, title, and responses.</p>

You can view all your messages related to each listing, keep track of how-row much each buyer offered, and respond right in the dashboard. When it's sold, you can even email everyone else at once to let them know.</p>

      <h4>Because Craigslist Rocks</h4>
      <p>Craigslist is the best way to buy and sell used stuff because of the huge network of people already using it, not because it's fast, easy, or intuitive. We're Craigslist users that weren't satisfied with the experience, so we built some tools to make it better. </p>
      <p>Our goal is to make the entire process easier, from the moment you decide to sell until the money is in your hand.</p>
      <p>If you have any feedback or an idea to make our site better, please don't hesitate to email us at <a href="mailto:info@rocketlistings.com"> info@rocketlistings.com</a></p>
