# Rocket Listings - Django

## Setup

### Python installation

I think Python `2.7.3` is installed on OSX Mountain Lion by default, you can check this by running `python -V` in your terminal. If you don't have `2.7.3` installed for any reason, just install the homebrew version of python by running:

	brew install python 

If you don't have homebrew installed, get it installed [here](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). 

Try running `python -V` again. If you don't get `2.7.3` this time, the problem likely has to do with your terminal paths. Go:

	sudo subl /etc/hosts

and edit it to look like this, before saving and closing the file:

	/usr/local/bin
	/usr/local/sbin
	/usr/bin
	/usr/sbin
	/bin
	/sbin

After restarting your terminal, the output of `python -V` should be `2.7.3`.

### Django installation

Run this:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

`pip` is one of Python's package managers. It definitely comes packaged with the homebrew version of python, but idk whether it comes with the Mountain Lion version. If you find you don't have `pip` then your should probably switch over to a homebrew python installation.

### Postgres installation

Run this to make sure that you don't have multiple versions of Postgres installed:

	brew rm --force postgres

Now download and run the [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com/).

Name your postgres user `teddyknox` and keep the password blank. Later on I'll be changing this username to something like `rocketlistings`, but for now I want to focus on development and not postgres administration. 

### Rocket Listings installation
Run this in the folder that you want to contain the project (requires that `git` be installed):

	git clone git@github.com:Rocket-Listings/Rocket-Listings-Django.git

When that's done, cd into the new `Rocket-Listings-Django` directory and run:

	python manage.py syncdb

If that runs without errors, it means your postgres install is working. That's very very good. Think about how good that is. 

After this command, the terminal may prompt you for you to add some superuser information. This is for administration of the local site, and has nothing to do with the codebase, so feel free to put your own info in there. 

### Start the development server

Now we can start the server by running, in the same folder, this command:

	python manage.py runserver

If you direct your browser to:

	http://localhost:8000/

You'll hopefully find the new version of the Rocket Listings site.

Let's stop for a second and realize how much easier that was than setting up the PHP site with all its Rails migrations, git submodule syncing, and apache virtual hosts.

## Development Stuff

### Conventions

#### CSS

We're using only classes (rather than ids). I used to think this was stupid, but now I've realized that not having to worry about whether any given selector is a class or an id is actually really nice. Also it encourages generic styling, i.e. reusing style on different stuff.

We're also using all lowercase class names, with multiple words separate by hyphens ('-'). The naming convention is pretty arbitrary, but I want to keep it consistent. While I like camelCase a lot, I think it's less flexible and harder to read sometimes. But again, we're only doing this for consistency, not because one convention is much better than another.

We've switched over to doing our styles using LESS styling. Less is a "dynamic stylesheet language" which affords us a lot more power and a lot less redundancy when styling. Read up on it at [LessCss.org](http://lesscss.org/). With it, we can nest our styling rules, so that there's MUCH less repetition. After you get used to it doing styles becomes a lot less painful and disorganized. Features like mixins and variables are also great. Less stylesheets are not valid CSS obviously, so they need to be compiled to CSS before being served up to the web browser. Usually you'd have to do the conversion using a command-line program every time you'd make a change to a .less file, but using this nifty [OSX app called Less.app](http://incident57.com/less/) you can specify folders containing .less files that you want to be automatically compiled to .css files. So the app will automatically recompile the less files whenever you save changes, placing .css files with the same names in the same directory. I set the app up with all of the project's `static/css` folders, and usually keep this app open in the background when I work. __With all this in mind, never directly edit the .css files, or your changes will probably be overwritten the next time the corresponding .less files are compiled__. 

The .less and .css files are separated by "application". An application in Django is any modular part of a project. So our project here is Rocket Listings, and our applications right now include 'listings', 'accounts', 'static_pages', and will later on include 'payment', 'api' and other separate stuff. Applications are separated by folder; those folders are in the project root (inside `Rocket-Listings-Django`). Within each application's folder, you'll find another folder called `static` that holds all the static resources for that application. Static resources are resources that aren't dynamic. Templates are dynamic, because they're not served up to the user 'as-is', but instead have all kinds of custom data plugged into them. But css files, images, and javascript files are static, because they remain the same no matter what. So within this `static` folder you'll find a bunch of other folders with the relevant js, css, less, and images for a given application. The 'rocketlistings' application is special because it represents the header and footer templates and static resources for the whole site. Global styles for things that appear on every page of the site go in the global.less stylesheet in the 'rocketlistings' app. Static pages (pages that themselves don't change much at all) like the homepage and FAQ page are all kept in the 'static\_pages' app.

So separating static resources by application is really helpful from an organizational standpoint, but not from technical standpoint. When we eventually deploy to production, want to be able to serve these static files using a real server, not just the Django development server. 'Real' servers include 'Apache', 'Lighttpd', 'nginx' and a few other. These servers excel at returning static files over http. So we want to let the real server do the work of returning the static files. We also want our static resources to have nice urls like this:

	http://www.rocketlistings.com/static/img/logo.png
	http://www.rocketlistings.com/static/css/global.css
	http://www.rocketlistings.com/static/js/ajaxupload.js

We want the URLs to look like that no matter what application the resources are coming from. The problem is that the way the 'real' servers are set up, we'd have to point them to the 'static' folder of each app separately, instead of having one big combinded folder of static files. Django anticipates this problem, and, when getting ready to deploy, populates a folder in the project root called `staic_collected` to contain all of these static files (but still organized in their respective 'css', 'js', or 'img' folders). This makes it much easier to serve up these files later on. Since we're not getting ready to deploy anytime soon, `static_collected` is kept empty, and you can ignore that folder when you're developing. Actually, since that folder isn't even in version control, you really have nothing to worry about at all. 

#### Sublime text Project Settings

If you haven't already, go ahead and create a sublime text project around the root project folder. Save the project as whatever and place the project file inside that root project folder. Our `.gitignore` file knows to ignore those types of files. This makes it so that you can have this nifty sidebar which shows you all of the project files. All of the project files show up: `.py`, `.html`, the `.png`, and even the `__init__.py` files. But we kinda don't want that, since you're never going to want to edit an image in the text editor, and you want to ignore `__init__.py` files. To make Sublime text ignore these types of files, open up your `.sublime-project` file and make it look like this (with the exception of the `path` field):

	{
		"folders":
		[
			{
				"path": "<KEEP THIS FIELD THE SAME>",
				"file_exclude_patterns":[
					"*.sublime-project",
					"*.sublime-workspace",
					"*.css",
					"__init__.py",
					".gitignore"
				],
	        	"folder_exclude_patterns": [
	           		"img",
	           		"static_collected"
	        	]
			}
		]
	}

You should have much less visual clutter when looking through your project folders now.
